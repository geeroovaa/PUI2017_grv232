The hypothesis suggested here wants to test for speedof men vs women

Verifications

a. Hypothesis formulation: 
 Null and alternate hypothesis are formulated correctly
 
 Suggestion: Using a formula would have helped in understanding better as the statement is too lengthy.
 
b. Data for project:

 Data used supports the project. Though speed is not a column in the dataset, it is calculated by from distance 
  and time duration

C. Test Suggestion
Z-score is already calculated in the notebook

Another Test Suggested: Chi square test

Refering to the chart of tests by type of question, since the hypothesis falls in the category of one variable
which is speed in this case and two categories i.e. men and women, chi square test for heterogenity can be used
here.
