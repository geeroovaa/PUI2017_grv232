Review of classmate's Citibike project proposal

_a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly_

Gerardo's idea for this homework was to compare the average speed between men and women. However, from the formulation of the Null Hypothesis is was not clear either what the Null Hypothesis should be nor the Alternative Hypothesis. This due to both steted the same concept. 

We learned that Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis should complement each other. However in this case it is stating the same but in the 'opposite way'. For example it would be as in flipping a coin we say the two options are: Heads and Not tails; not tails being heads we are saying the same.  This is exactly the problem that Gerardo ran into. 

H0: Women's average speed is the same or lower than men 
HA: The alternative hypothesis: Men bike faster than women do.

We could infer that his idea was that men bike faster than women, but the fact that the HO and HA are the same doesn't support this, in a simple example it is easier to spot it out, but even by that it is open to errors. 

The significance level was correct set from the start to 0.05. Which is exactly what needs to be done. 

My proposal for a Null Hypothesis would be:
- Women's average biking speed is same or higher than men's average speed. 

And the Alternative Hypothesis:
- Women's average biking speed is lower than men's.  


_b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)_

For his analysis he prepared the Data correctly by dropping all columns that would not provide information related to: gender, duration, and distance.  Then by using the basic Speed formula. v = d/t he calculates the speed for each trip and adds a column to the DataFrame. This was done correctly. 

_c. chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked._

By looking at the flow chart provided I would suggest a Chi square test as we are comparing the value in one category (females) to another category (males).
