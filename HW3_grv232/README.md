I worked in this hw by myself with some help from Dr. Bianco's git repository and Labs

# Assignment 1
I created 100 data samples for each distribution and then plotted the mean to prove the central limit theorem.
They all complied with this theorem. The more the size of the sample tended to infinity the more the sample mean tended to the population's. mean.
The histograms were plotted for each data distribution with all of them having different patterns.

# Assignment 2
I assessed if men biked faster than women using the citi bike data. The hypothesis hold true.

# Assignment 3
I finished the Z test lab to find out that the new bus line actually decreased the trips avergae time.
