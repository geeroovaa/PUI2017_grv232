# Plot Review for grv232

This plot examines how AIDS has quickly spread in population of New York City in the early 1990s, and gives interesting insight on how it affected different groups of the New York City  population.

__CLARITY__: 

It is clear to understand what the plot is examining -- especially because the title is clear. 
However, since there is a lot of information displayed, it is a bit hard to match every line with the scale. I would suggest to add a light grid in the background.

__AESTHETIC__: 

I think the aesthetics of the plot suffer a bit from trying to put too many lines  at the same time. Some lines are overlapping so it is hard to see their trend at a first glance. I would suggest to focus only on some information. For instance, you could remove the Total, since it reports information that is already present in the other lines. 

Moreover, since there is already a lot going on at the plot, I would remove the label "AIDS main cause of dead men" . The same information is already present in the caption, and the peak is pretty easy to identify anyways, so it seems redundant. 

Lastly, I would place the caption below the figure, as I think it would make it stand our more and serve better the purpose of explaining the plot. 

__HONESTY__: 

The plot has clear axis labelling and legend. However, I would suggest to use percentage of population affected instead of absolute number of cases. I also find a bit confusing that men are divided in "homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual" groups while females are not. I would either only concentrate on males or report the same groups for both genders.
