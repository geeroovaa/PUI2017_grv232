I worked with Cao Baiyue on the second assignment and a few doubts I had with spatial coordinate delimitation for the fouth part. For the first part I reviewed Ruben's null hypothesis and asked him not to relate distance and time for both genders as if the speed was the same. On the second part we reviewed a series of papers and identified the tests that best suited the data types that were being worked on. 
For the third part several hypothesis for a convict program were tested under the Z and Chi-squared test.
On the last part I worked with citibike data, comparing trip duration by day and night and age by borough (Manhattan and Brooklyn). Three test were used to assess the statistical similar or different; which all of the test showed they were with significant low p-values.

# FBB OK on finding variables etc BUT: the NULL should state the opposite of the effect you seek to test: the Nurses who had higher self-evaluation characteristics, reported SAME OR MORE emotional exhaustion and cynicism, and higher professional efficacy. Mean rest-CBF is NOT related to general intelligence etc
